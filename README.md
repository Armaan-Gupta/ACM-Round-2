# ACM Round - 2

Greetings everyone!!

I would like to walk you through my learning process of coding. I had absolutely no knowledge of coding of till the end of class 12. It was after JEE that i did start
learning python. I started with a course called 100 Days of Code on Udemy, completed till day 8 before coming to BITS. After coming here, i further managed to complete
till day 12. Till Day 12, all the basics (conditions, loops, variables, lists, tupules, functions) are properly covered, with a small project each day to practice
concepts.

Now i have learnt a lot more
